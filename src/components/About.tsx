          I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with a strong 
          foundation in web technologies, particularly in React and Flutter. 
          Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Computer Science 
          at Concordia University, I have honed my skills in building dynamic 
          and responsive applications. My experience includes developing 
          serverless architectures, implementing secure authentication systems, 
          and creating user-friendly interfaces that enhance user engagement. 
          I thrive on challenges and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional 
          teams to deliver innovative solutions. <br />
            <br /> With a keen interest in both frontend and backend development, 
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skill set. 
            My projects reflect my commitment to quality and efficiency, whether 
            t's optimizing application performance or ensuring seamless user 
            experiences. I am excited to contribute my technical expertise 
            and creativity to impactful projects that make a difference.
